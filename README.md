"Fork My Life" (FML)
--------------------

This repository contains the repo manifest used to build the Fork My Life ROM.

This particular branch of the repository is the manifest used for the AOSP Lollipop release.

**NOTICE:** Any of the code or build modifications made pertaining to optimizations are only **guaranteed** to compile for the Galaxy Nexus (tuna) target, but should be applicable to just about any ARMv7 target with little or no modification required. Some of it can be **extremely fragile**, so take care to thoroughly test *everything*.

While FML started off as a project of mine to optimize the internals of Android, squeezing every last bit of performance possible out of the aging Galaxy Nexus, it has become much more than that.

It resulted in me (<a href="https://github.com/MWisBest/">MWisBest</a>) collaborating with <a href="https://github.com/Ziyann/">Ziyan</a> and <a href="#OMAP4XXX_Team">an entire team</a>, brought together by <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/member.php?u=2838735">aosp</a>, to breathe new life into the Galaxy Nexus by giving its kernel and device tree a complete overhaul, ultimately culminating in one of our biggest goals: <a href="http://www.xda-developers.com/android/galaxy-nexus-gets-new-life-with-updated-gpu-drivers/">updating the GPU drivers</a>.

That work would go on to play a key role in easing the process of getting Android 5.0 "Lollipop" running on the Galaxy Nexus, taking **less than 24 hours** after the AOSP Lollipop source code was released for the first screenshots to appear. While there are a few minor things to fix yet, the big stuff is already working well and is, for many people, useable as their main OS of choice.

Official builds of FML can be found at the corresponding project thread for the three Galaxy Nexus variants:<br>
